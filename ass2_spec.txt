[Assignment Spec]  [Schema]

Downloads: a2.tgz, a2.zip 
Note that a2.tgz and a2.zip contain the same material.
Each archive contains the IMDB database dump a2.db, a sample PHP code file, a2.php plus updates.sql.
Aims
This assignment aims to give you practice in

further use of SQL and PLpgSQL
writing scripts in PHP that interact with a database
The goal is to complete the functionality of some command-line tools via a combination of database code and PHP code.

Required Files:   a2.php, updates.sql, acting, title, toprank, similar, shortest, degrees

Deadline:   Friday 19 April 2018 @ 23.59

Late Penalty:   Late submissions will have marks deducted from the maximum achievable mark at the rate of 0.5% of the total mark per hour that they are late (i.e., 12% per day).

This assignment contributes 15 marks toward your total mark for this course. 
The mark for each question indicates (roughly) its level of difficulty.
The total marks for the questions sum to 15.
How to do this assignment:

read this specification carefully and completely
create a directory for this assignment
unpack the supplied zip file into this directory
login to grieg and run your PostgreSQL server
remove your Assignment 1 database (to save space)
create a new database called a2 for your assignment 2
load the schema and populate the data into the database by psql -f a2.db a2
perform any required updates to the database by psql -f updates.sql a2
re-acquaint yourself with the database (by browsing the data using psql and/or examine its schema through the link [Schema] above)
familiarise (read the code) yourself with the provided sample PHP code file called pg
make sure pg (by chmod u+x pg) and run it
complete the tasks using pg as a reference example, you may also want to edit the supplied template files a2.php and updates.sql
submit all these files (the Required Files) via WebCMS3 as described above
Details of the above steps are given below. Note that you can put the files wherever you like; they do not have to be under your /srvr directory. You can also edit the PHP and SQL files on hosts other than grieg. The only time that you need to use grieg is to manipulate your database or to run your PHP scripts.

You will probably not be able to fit both the database for Assignment 1 and the database for Assignment 2 into your PostgreSQL server on grieg (because of your quota on /srvr).

Introduction
A successful movie (or TV show) not only entertains audience, but also enables film companies to gain tremendous profit. A lot of factors (such as good directors, experienced actors) are important for creating good movies. Nevertheless, famous directors and actors usually bring an attractive box-office income, but they do not necessarily guarantee a highly rated imdb score. This assignment is based on an IMDB dataset to build several small PHP commands to show interesting results.

The dataset itself contains around 5000 movies, spanning across 100 years in 66 countries. There are more than 2000 movie directors, and thousands of actors/actresses. It also contains the IMDB rating score, numbers of votes and various facebook likes. To let you feel the kind of data that you are dealing with, a (unordered) glimpse of the dataset is included below:

Submission and Testing
We will test your submission on Grieg as follows:

create a testing subdirectory
untar the a2.tgz file into that directory
load your submitted a2.php and updates.sql files over the top of the standard ones
create a new database a2 and initialise it with a2.db (For testing purposes, the dataset may be modified and slightly different from the dataset in your a2.db)
run the command:   psql a2 -f updates.sql   (using your updates.sql)
run a series of tests using your submitted acting, title, toprank, similar, shortest and degrees scripts
manually inspect your submitted PHP code and SQL code
Your submitted code must be complete so that when we do the above, your PHP will work just as it did in your assignment directory and with a database with the identical schema (with either the same or slightly modified dataset) to yours (a2.db). If your code does not work when installed for testing on Grieg, as described above (for example, your updates.sql did not contain all of the required definitions, or you did not submit all of the required PHP files, etc), you will be penalised by a 50% administrative penalty.

Some things that you can do wrong:

make changes to files other than a2.php, updates.sql and the corresponding PHP commandline files (such as toprank)
forget to include all of your PHP functions in a2.php or other PHP files
forget to include all of your SQL and PLpgSQL definitions in updates.sql
Before you submit, you should test out whether the files you submit will work by following a similar sequence of steps to those noted above on Grieg.

Tasks
For each task, you are required to implement an executable PHP program command that takes in commandline arguments and displays the result in a specified format (which we will use for auto-marking). We assume the sample output format for each task below to to test your programs. In particular, as shown in the code of pg, if any field of your output is empty, you should hide that field and its related formatting text (for example, in pg, a comma and a space will not be printed for duration if it is empty). Of course, you are free to print debugging information temporarily (e.g. to add debugging print_r() calls), but please remember to eventually disable or remove them when your solution is submitted for marking. For all the tasks below, unless it is specified explicitly, we assume movies including any titles stored in the movie table (i.e., including movies and TV shows etc).

In implementing your functions, you are free to partition the functionality however you like between the database and the PHP scripts. In the past, some students have solved similar assignments to this by writing just about everything in SQL views and PLpgSQL functions and using PHP simply as a vehicle for collecting the results. Others have done most of the computational work in PHP. Do whatever you feel most comfortable with, but make sure that you limit your changes just to the files that you are required to submit, and do not create additional tables.

For each task below, output nothing if there is no result returned from the database. If the task does not specify particular output order, your program can output in any row order. If multiple columns are involved in your output, your output should follow the same column order as the sample output presented in each task below (for example, the order of the fields inside the brackets of the pg output matters).


Task A: The list of movies acted by a given actor (1 marks)
The acting script lists the movie title, its director, its year, its content rating and IMDB score, one per line, of all the movies acted by the given actor. The output is sorted by year and then by movie title, both in ascending order. If any movies have empty year, output them at the end and sort them by movie title in ascending order. It accepts one command-line argument: an actor name (has to exactly match a name stored in the database and the matching is case insensitive). It has the following output format:

grieg$ ./acting "james franco"

26. Sausage Party -- Greg Tiernan (2016, R, 7.5)
For all the tasks in this assignment, as mentioned previously, your program shall output nothing if there are no results. If there are N results, it shall output exactly N lines of output without any extra lines or messages. We can then use the line count to measure the size of an output. For example:
grieg$ ./acting "james franco"|wc -l
26
grieg$ ./acting "john smith" |wc -l
0
                

Task B: List movie information by its title substring (1 marks)
The title script lists the movie title, year, content rating, IMDB score and genres of those movies with the title matching the given substring (case insensitive), one per line. The output of multiple genres of a movie should be concatenated in one line delimited by a comma and sorted alphabetically in ascending order, as shown by an example below. The rows are ordered by year (ascending), then by IMDB rating (descending) and finally by title (ascending). It has the following output format:

grieg$ ./title "star war"

Task C: Top ranked movies (2 marks)
The toprank script takes in 3 or 4 commandline arguments:

./toprank K StartYear EndYear
or:
./toprank Genres K StartYear EndYear
where Genres is a list of genres separated by '&', K is the top K movies ranked by IMDB score and then by the number of votes (both in descending order) between (and including) StartYear and EndYear, with 1 <= K <= 1000, 1900 < StartYear <= EndYear < 2020 and your program will not be tested with a list of more than 8 genres. We interpret '&' as conjunction, i.e., the selected movies shall contain all the specified genres. When Genres is not provided (when your program takes in 3 arguments), perform the same ranking but on movies with any genres. Do not include any movie titles with empty year. For example:

Task D: Similar movies (3 marks)
Suppose you are asked to implement a movie recommendation feature for IMDB. Based on the movie that a user is currently browsing, a list of similar movies will be presented. In Task D, the similar script takes in 2 arguments: a case-insensitive movie full title (this shall produce a single match. If not, just use the one with the most recent year as if it is the only match); and a number N (1 <= N <= 1000). It will then find its similar N movies (excluding itself) that share the maximum number of common genres (output nothing if no other movies have any common genres with the given movie). For those with the same number of common genres, they will then be ranked by the maximum number (including zero number) of common plot keywords. If both are the same, then they will be ranked by their IMDB scores and then by the number of votes (the higher the better).

Task E: Six degrees of Kevin Bacon (4 marks)
Tasks E & F are inspired by Six degrees of Kevin Bacon. The shortest script takes in two actor names (with case insensitive matching), and lists the shortest path (up to Six Degrees of Separation) between two given actors. In other words, if two actors are not connected within six degrees, you can assume that they are not connected at all. The output will be a list of actors, the movies and the years. If there are more than one the same shortest paths, output all of them (all output lines are sorted alphabetically in ascending order). Reference(Wikipedia): Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
